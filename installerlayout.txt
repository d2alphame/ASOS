The installation floppy of ASOS is laid out as follows:

ASOS makes use of only the first 2 tracks on the installation floppy.
On each track, only the first 2 sectors are for the installer's code.
The rest of the sectors on each of those tracks then contains the os code to be installed.

Each track on the 1.44MB floppy has 18 sectors each.
The first two sectors on the first track as well as the first two sectors of the second
track contain the installer's code. This means ASOS's installer is 2KB (512 bytes per sector).

The operating system's code then occupies the remaining 16 sectors on each of the first two
tracks. This makes a total of 32 sectors. So the OS code is 16KB long
(i.e. 32 sectors * 512 bytes per sector)
