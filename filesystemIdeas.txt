Total number of possible entries		= 65536
Bytes per entry					= 32
Total number of bytes for all entries	= 32 * 65536	= 2097152
Number of sectors reserved for entries	= 2097152 / 512	= 4096
Number of clusters reserved for entries	= 4096 / 8		= 512
Number of bytes for miscellaneous use	= 512 * 32		= 65536

Explanation:

Total number of possible entries: 65536
This is the total number of clusters that can make up the entire file system

Bytes per entry: 32
Each file entry is 32 bytes long. This includes file name and other attributes

Total number of bytes for entries: 32 * 65536 = 2097152
This is the total number of bytes that is required for all entries

Number of sectors reserved for all entries: 2097152 / 512 = 4096
This is the total number of sectors that should be reserved for the entries. This assumes 512 bytes per sector

Number of clusters reserved for all entries: 4096 / 8 = 512
This is the number of clusters that should be reserved for the entries. This assumes 512 bytes per sector and
8 sectors per cluster

Number of bytes for miscellaneous use: 512 * 32 = 65536
This is the total number of bytes available for miscellaneous use. It is actually the file entries that would have
been used for the reserved clusters. In our case we use these for bootstrap code and other things.

This means the first file entry will be located in sector 128 (65536 / 512), and the file itself will be located in
cluster number 512 (cluster numbering starts from 0) or 2097152 bytes in.

It also means when searching for a file entry, start searching at 16. (65536/4096 where 4096 is the number of bytes
per cluster) E.g.

.loop:
    mov cx, 16
    #(scan filename)
    #(if file found jmp to load_file)
    #(else if cx = 0xFFFF then scan is done)
    inc cx
    jmp .loop

load_file:
    shl cx, 3               ; multipy by 8 (number of sectors per cluster) to get lba offset.
    add cx, lba_start       ; lba_start is the lba of first sector of partition or filesystem
    #(load 8 sectors)
